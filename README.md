[Ethics in Agile Processes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01206-4)




Software Engineers influence people’s life through features and the embedded ethical judgments impact their design of software artifacts. The article talks about while considering the features of technology, it is critical to identify the comprehensive technological values embedded in software. Examples like data analysis should have regards in data processing where data interpretation and discrimination & privacy issues should be addressed. When software developers are implementing product design, the values that are implicitly embedded in the software such as potential negative externalities for the user should be considered when making design decisions. A new concept I learn from the article is that ethical engineering/design is not about allowing machines to act autonomously without a moral agent but to encourage machines to perpetuate values or transform normative expectations. 


The paper mentioned a couple methods to enhance ethical deliberation in agile: promoting flat hierarchies and focus on autonomy of engineer, team collaboration, provision of techno-ethical realism, introducing clear endpoints for ethical deliberations…etc are all methods to facilitate a better agile development process.
